## Cooper Brislain's Interactive Resume

This is the repo for my interactive resume on GitHub Pages.

The goal of this project was to create a compelling, 
interactive experience utilizing github pages, javascript,
and the canvas. 

To interact with the page, click on any of the skills in the technical
skills section, or any of the highlighted terms in the job descriptions.
upon selecting a skill, the work experience will be filtered for jobs
that utilized that skill or similar skills, while highlighting the
each time it appears in a description and drawing a connecting line 
between them.

This repo works thanks to the following:
